# Starting a Project with Node

This repository is a chance for you to practice starting a project from scratch with Node and NPM.

## Instructions

- Create a new `package.json` file.
- Install `mocha` and `chai` as developer dependencies.
- Change the test script so that it runs `mocha`. You should now be able to run `npm test`.
- Export `colors` and `randomColor` as a literal object in `src/main.js`
- Require `src/main.js` in `test/main.test.js` so that the test have access to the functions they are testing.
- Make sure the tests pass

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
1. Run the tests with `npm test`
